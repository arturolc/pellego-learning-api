            This method of reading is known as “Rapid Serial Visual Presentation” or RSVP for short. 
            Studies have shown the habit of internally “sounding out” (sub-vocalising) words is a limiting 
            factor which prevents faster reading speeds from being obtained. RSVP eliminates the “sounding out” 
            of words as individual words are not displayed long enough for sub-vocalisation to occur.

            RSVP proves that humans are capable of absorbing information at speeds much faster than standard 
            reading rates with the same level of comprehension.
